Create a Windows project launcher with GUI. Requirements:
1. ONLY ONE self-contained batch file
2. Must be saved in a folder named ".RUN"
3. File must be named "RUN.bat"
4. Embed all code inside the batch file (no external files)
5. GUI with: folder browser, run button, output display
6. Auto-detect and run: Python/Node.js/C#/batch projects
7. NO multiple versions, NO debugging, NO alternatives
8. The batch file must contain embedded PowerShell GUI code
9. Must work immediately when double-clicked
10. Final deliverable: .RUN/RUN.bat (nothing else)


Even Shorter Version:
Create ONE self-contained RUN.bat file in .RUN folder that opens a GUI to browse/run any project. Embed everything in the batch file. No external files. No alternatives.


Ultra-Short:
Make .RUN/RUN.bat with embedded GUI that runs any project. ONE FILE ONLY.
